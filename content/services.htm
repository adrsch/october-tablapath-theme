<p>Doug Scheuerell maintains an active private studio and is dedicated to teaching new and continuing students of all ages. Lessons are generally one hour in duration but different arrangements can be made. Often longer lessons are arranged for students who travel from out of Eugene for their lessons. The frequency of the lessons is left to the discretion of the student, but one lesson per week is recommended. Good quality new and used tabla from the best craftsmen in India are available for rent or purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instrument repair services are also available. Doug Scheuerell will repair cracks and other problems, "pull" (to tune), or re-head instruments.</p>
